# PARSIQ CryptoPunks Offers and Bids Tracking Dashboard
We created three PARSIQ Platform Smart Triggers that respond to CryptoPunks directly related on-chain events and follow custom logic to deliver all necessary transaction information about the price action. On top of that we created a Web App to present the information to End User in Real Time.
